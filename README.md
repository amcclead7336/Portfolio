Welcome

Thank you for stopping by my page.
I'm currently working on multiple projects to expand my skill set.

My primary field of study is Cybersecurity. I have recently moved forward in this field by Passing the CEH exam.

I'm also an avid learner of Programming, focusing on Machine learning, cybersecurity, and automation.

I have a youtube chanel where I create instructional videos on tools that I've learned in my studies.

Thank you for stopping by,
Alex
